# Topic Decomposition

# Research Threats
Crucial step before we go into a 2 week sprint, look for various threats for the VM’s to have

## Malware
Look for or develop common pieces of malware that can affect a system

### Trojan
Pieces of software that are disguised as something legitimate

### Phishing Lure
A malicious document that runs other unwanted software

### Backdoor
Gives an attacker unauthorized access to a system

### Rootkits
Hook an operating system’s API calls and cause unwanted actions

### Remote Access Toolkit
Give an attacker control over the affected host and allow actions to be taken remotely

## Penetration Testing Frameworks
Allows us to find vulnerabilities/ emulate a threat actor on various systems

### Metasploit
Ruby based penetration testing tool that provides modules for exploiting common vulnerabilities

## Security Frameworks
Research common frameworks and determine common vulnerabilities

### MITRE ATT&CK
Documents common attacker techniques at all stages of the attack lifecycle

### OWASP
OWASP Top 10, an awareness document covering various web application security threats

## Security Misconfigurations
Simple misconfigurations/ failure to implement security controls for all servers or web applications  

## Data Breach Reports
Any publications/reports that cover Data Breaches will provide insight of how they were able to perform the task

### Verizon Data Breach Investigation Reports
Annual publication that provides knowledge of various information security incidents in regards to data

### Mandiant M-Trends
Another annual publication which contains insight of the most impactful cyber attacks of the year

## Vulnerable Software
Research vulnerabilities introduced by software installation

# CyberPatriots Sprint Cycle
Produce Deliverables detailed under Material Distribution every two weeks

## Lab Guides
Guides will need to be provided to the students as well as the teacher/instructor

### Catering of Audience
CyberPatriots is a K-12 program, but to our knowledge we will mostly be working with Middle to High School students, we will need to be mindful of how we describe steps due to this

### Impact of Threat
Explain how each threat introduced to an environment is impactful to the affected organization

### Remediation of Threat
Explain how to resolve issues caused by the specific threat/ how to prevent the specific threat

### Technical Explanations
Detail technical details of why threats are impactful

### Red Team Perspective
Explain the threat from the red team perspective

### Blue Team Perspective
Explain the threat from the blue team perspective

## VM’s
Create virtual environments that are intentionally vulnerable 

### Windows VM
Produce content for student to introduce a threat in a virtual windows environment 

### Linux VM
Produce a VM of linux for students to explore Threats

### PowerShell Scripts
Make a PowerShell script in order to introduce a threat to a Windows Virtual Environment

### Source Code
Make source code of any scripts produced available to the parent CyberPatriots organization

### Obfuscation
Obfuscate scripts to ensure students must find vulnerabilities to emulate a true environment

### Obfuscated PowerShell Script
Obfuscate the PowerShell Script in order for the student to figure out issue on their own

### Obfuscated PowerShell .EXE
Obfuscate a Windows executable file containing a packaged PowerShell script

### Obfuscated Bash Script
Obfuscate a Linux Bash script to introduce vulnerabilities into an environment

### Obfuscated ELF Binary
Obfuscate a Linux executable file containing a packaged Bash script

### Bash Scripting
Scripting in a Linux environment to easily introduce a threat for the student to solve

### Saved VM File
Save an intentionally vulnerable Linux environment

# Material Distribution
How we will deliver our developed materials for usage amongst the Cyber Patriots

## Lab Guides
Deliver finished lab guides to guide student learning

## Linux VM
Deliver intentionally vulnerable Linux VM for student Learning

## Windows Script .exe
Deliver finished scripts or executables to create a vulnerable Windows VM

Worked on together with Brandon Wilbur
