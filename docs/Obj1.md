### Project/Sprint 1

## CyberPatriot Vulnerable VM Labs

For Brandon and I's first sprint of our project, we wanted to test the waters with something that would not be too intensive, but still provide us enough of a challenge to not only see how our work process would go, but also for Duane, to see if what we are putting forth is good enough for the CyberPatriots. Therefore, we decided we would be creating a set of labs for the CyberPatriots that involves and demonstrates various levels of Privilege Escalation. These types of attacks can be quite critical to a system, have various different types such as Horizontal Escalation and can be done through many different methods within Windows and Linux. For this sprint in particular, I will be taking the Linux side while Brandon works on Windows. We are organizing this within a Trello board, where we will organize our research as well as our sprint status. 

## Trello

In Trello, we are organizing all of our potential future Security Vulnerabilities for usage in other sprints, current documents and readings for the Vulnerability of our current sprint. Specific Vulnerabilities can be added by us, or by others pending on recommendations. For our sprints, we will be documenting everything that we complete and will be moved to a backlog upon completion.

## Sprints/Deliverables

Our sprints will be conducted in 2 week intervals, and upon the end of each sprint, we will need to had in two separate lab documentation one for Linux and one for Windows, as well as the Vulnerable Linux VM for the students to use and scripts for the Windows box to make itself vulnerable, due to us not legally being able to share Windows VMâ€™s.
