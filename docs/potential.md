### Potential Project Ideas

## CyberPatriot Vulnerable VM Labs

This specific project I am currently planning on working with another student, Brandon Wilbur, alongside Duane Dunston. The main goal of this project would to make Virtual Machines with specific vulnerabilities to be used for the CyberPatriots, a national run youth program that focuses on teaching students K-12 about cybersecurity. One of the first steps of this project would be determing either to focus on either a Windows VM, a Linux VM or both currently. To my knowledge currently, the Linux VM;s will need to be updated/ recieve new vulnerabilities about every 2 weeks, which will be a large upkeep, meanwhile with the Windows VM, usage of powershell would most likely need to be used in order to create the majority of these vulnerabilities. In addition to making these VM's, documentation will need to be created in the form of guides for the students to use in order for them to not only learn about these vulnerabilites, but also have the capability to find these vulnerabilities as well. This project will not only reinforce many of the ideas and concepts that we have learned throughout our college experience in terms of hardening security, but we are also going to be giving back to the community and potentially impacting a whole new generation of students who would be interested within the cybersecurity field.
