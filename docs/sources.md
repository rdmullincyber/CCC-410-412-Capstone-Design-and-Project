This will be helpful in demonstrating proper methods for reporting vulnerabilities that can be used in lab guides. |

Metasploit could be used to create remote access toolkits or to use public exploits in developing malware. |

While this may seem basic, I believe the obfuscation methods may be an overall boon to us, to see what not to do for our methods essentially. We can learn from these easily detectable methods, to make ours better. Not only that but if it does go deep enough within the analysis, I believe it can also be helpful for us for when we develop our own executables perhaps. |

This will be needed to “hide” our executable malware for both Linux and Windows VMs. We want to use this so when the CyberPatriots run our programs to make their environment vulnerable, obfuscation will make it so they can’t easily look into it to find out what we did or changed. |

This can be a helpful resource for us to get a better understand of how to explain to the CyberPatriot kids why what they are doing is important, as well as giving us the idea some of the most popular ways attacks are performed, which we then could try to simulate in our VM’s. |
